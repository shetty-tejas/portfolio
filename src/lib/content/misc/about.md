## {title}

I'm a developer based in Mumbai, India. I currently work at [Sage](https://www.sage.com) as a **Senior Engineer**,
where I’m part of the team building [Sage Network](https://www.sage.com/en-us/sage-network/) and the [Sage E-Invoicing Portal](https://network.sage.com/e-invoicing/register).

After hours, I like to tinker with ideas and build things I enjoy.
Lately, that means working on a few SaaS products using **Ruby on Rails** and **SvelteKit**,
diving into **Go**, and exploring deeper engineering topics like building interpreters and writing concurrent applications.
I also try to contribute to **open-source** whenever I can — PRs, fixes, small features, anything that helps.

When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me [running, biking, or swimming]("https://www.strava.com/athletes/110074637"),
i.e. hustling towards becoming a **triathlete**! I also enjoy reading sometimes, and when I’m feeling especially lazy... I just binge-watch YouTube!
