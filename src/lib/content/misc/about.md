I'm a developer based in Mumbai, India. I currently work at [Sage](https://www.sage.com) as a **Senior Engineer**,
where I’m part of the team building [Sage Network](https://www.sage.com/en-us/sage-network/) and the [Sage E-Invoicing Portal](https://www.sage.com/en-gb/sage-network/e-invoicing/).

After hours, I like to tinker with ideas and build things I enjoy.
Lately, that means working on a few SaaS products using **Ruby on Rails** and **SvelteKit**,
experimenting with **Go** and **C**, and exploring deeper engineering topics like interpreters, compilers, concurrent systems, and more.
I also try to contribute to **open source** whenever I can — PRs, fixes, small features, anything that helps.

When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me [running, biking, or swimming](https://www.strava.com/athletes/110074637),
i.e. hustling towards becoming a **triathlete**! I also enjoy reading sometimes, and when I’m feeling especially lazy... I just binge-watch YouTube!
