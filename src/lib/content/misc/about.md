I'm a developer based in Mumbai, India. I currently work at [Sage](https://www.sage.com) as an **Engineer**,
where I'm part of the team building [Sage E-Invoicing Portal](https://www.sage.com/en-gb/sage-network/e-invoicing/) and previously, [Sage Network](https://www.sage.com/en-gb/sage-network/ar-automation/).

After hours, I like to tinker with ideas and build things I enjoy.
Lately, that means building full-stack applications, experimenting with systems programming, 
and exploring deeper engineering topics like interpreters, compilers, concurrent systems, and more.
I also try to contribute to **open source** whenever I can — PRs, fixes, small features, anything that helps.

When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me training to become a **triathlete** or pounding away at my drums!
I also read sometimes, and when I'm feeling especially lazy... I just binge-watch YouTube!
