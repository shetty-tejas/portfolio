## Oh well, another portfolio in the sea...

You might be wondering why I created this portfolio... Well, maybe not... But I'll still talk about it!

This portfolio was initially going to be a simple web page, serving as a hosted resume for me to share.
I initially thought that a simple HTML file, some sleek CSS styling, and no JavaScript, would be sufficient for showcasing my resume.
The goal was least complexity as possible, while keeping the web page snappy.

So I started searching for an inspiration on how I wanted my web page to look like, and I discovered the [blog](https://mitchellh.com/) of Mitchell Hashimoto.
For those who are unaware, Mitchell is an absolute gigachad.
He co-founded [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/), worked extensively on [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant), and later
leaving the company, now focusing on different open-source projects, including [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org), which has been my primary tool for the past six months.

I was immediately impressed by his website design, and wanted something similar (sorry Mitchell!).
Additionally, I have always wanted to write blogs about topics that interest me, so this seemed like a good source of inspiration.

## So, how is this one made?

Well, this one was built on top of [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) and [MDSVEX](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/).
I absolutely adore SvelteKit due to its ease of development and management, its user-friendly nature (developer happiness++),
and its lightweight nature compared to other frameworks.
Furthermore, it supports Server Side Rendering out of the box, which was something I wanted to utilise, but ultimately chose Client Side Rendering
due to the nature of this website.

MDSVEX is a Markdown Processor built for integrating with SvelteKit.
All the write-ups, including the homepage, are written in markdown, and in certain locations, with some injected Svelte code for additional styling.

Frameworks aside, I opted for [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, as it significantly enhances productivity, and for a
smaller project like this, it made perfect sense.
For some of the icons (in places like the footer), I used [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/). They are quite handy and look nice with the current layout.
The fonts used throughout the website are [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) and [Aleo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Aleo), both from Google Fonts.
And finally, the colour theme I chose is [Catppuccin Mocha](https://catppuccin.com/palette/), as it is easy on the eyes and pretty cute in my opinion!

Of course, the template concept originated from Mitchell's blog (once again, sorry Mitchell!).

This portfolio is entirely open-source by the way, so you can check it out [here](https://github.com/shetty-tejas/portfolio)!

## What can I expect here?

I'm glad you asked! Since the start of this year, I have been diving deeper into computer science, systems engineering, and system design.
My goal with this portfolio is not only to showcase my resume, but also to share my learnings, experiences, and announcements (if any).
Essentially, giving back to the internet as much as I have gained from it!

## Cool... Any final words?

I hope you have as much fun exploring this website as I have had in creating and maintaining it!
Cheers, and I look forward to connecting with you soon. My socials are open for interaction, and you can find them below.
